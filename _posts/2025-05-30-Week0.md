## GSoC 2025: Kicking Off with Community, Code & Curiosity🚀

Hello! I'm Ashutosh, an undergraduate student from India and a contributor to **Google Summer of Code 2025** with **KDE**.

The past couple of weeks have been part of the **Community Bonding Period**, and I’ve focused on laying a solid foundation for the exciting journey ahead. Here’s a quick summary of what I’ve been up to:

### 🛠️ Development Environment Setup
- Installed **Fedora OS** as my development system.
- Set up **Qt Creator** and configured my environment.
- Successfully built and explored Gcompris  to get familiar with the workflow.

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice via Side Projects
To ramp up my understanding of **QML** and **JS**, I built a few small but useful apps:
-  **Memory Game** -It a simple flip cards game it involved learning of qml bindings ,emiting signals and Js logic as core of the game.

- **To-Do App** — includes adding tasks and saving data with dummy JSON.Understanding of ListView and ListModel.

- **Tic Tac Toe** -Similar to Memory Game ,it required state management and signal handling.

These projects helped me get comfortable with:
- QML syntax and structure
- Signal handling and dynamic UI updates
- Layouts and styling using Kirigami

### 👥 Community Bonding
During this period, I:
- Engaged with mentors and fellow KDE contributors.
- Got a better understanding of the expectations, communication channels, and contribution workflows.

### 💡 Looking Ahead
With the basics in place, I’m now preparing to dive into my GSoC project: **Improving Gcompris Server for Dataset Editor**, a part of the KDE Games suite. The next step is to start working on the basic prototype and  plan out the first milestone of the coding phase.

I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead. Huge thanks to the KDE community and mentors for being so welcoming and supportive. More updates soon! 😊
