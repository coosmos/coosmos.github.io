Welcome to my first blog post!

# week 1
### Week 1: Setting Up Mancala Development Environment ðŸš€

In the first week, I focused on laying the foundation for my Mancala game project. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my progress:

---

#### **1. Setting Up the Development Environment**  
I successfully set up the development environment for the Mancala game, ensuring all tools and libraries were configured for KDE's Kirigami framework.

---

#### **2. Research on Game UI**  
To design an engaging user interface (UI), I studied existing KDE apps, with **GCompris** being a major source of inspiration. 


---



#### **3. Initial Mockups**  
Based on my research, I designed the initial mockups for the game. Below are the screenshots of my progress:  

- **Load Screen:**  
  ![Desktop View](/resources/images/loadingScreen.png){: width="400" height="300"}
  ---

- **Main Menu:**  
  ![Main Menu](/resources/images/mainMenu.png){: width="400" height="300"}

- **Game Screen:**  
   ![GameScreen](/resources/images/gameScreen.png){: width="400" height="300"}

- **Game End Screen:**  
 ![Game End](/resources/images/gameEnd.png){: width="400" height="300"}

Alternatively, you can view the designs on **Figma** [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/ItbJRR4bx8ywpSsVJJnkwp/Mankala?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=13-17&p=f&viewport=-458%2C220%2C0.28&t=GhPFtbgR3whaQqL2-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6%3A8).

#### **4. Understanding the Game Logic**  
I am currently reading and understanding the existing game logic. My next step is to start implementing this logic using **Kirigami** in the upcoming week.

---

### What's Next?  
- Translate the mockup designs into Kirigami UI components.  
- Begin integrating the game logic with the UI.  

Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks! ðŸ˜Š
