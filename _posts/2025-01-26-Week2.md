Hello again :) 

_This is week 2 of my Sok journey so far_

---
## Kirigami Setup

This week, I started  with following up on a Kirigami tutorial.

 I followed the [official Kirigami documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/kirigami/introduction-getting_started/).

## Progress This Week

### Objective
My goal for this week was to start tweaking the UI in the **Main QML**, build a **landing page**, and then proceed to the **Main Menu** and other sections.

### Changes & Challenges
1. **Mentor's Recommendation:**
   - Benson Muite suggested that I create a **separate project** to first experiment with UI changes before modifying the main project.
   - Based on this, I started working on a **(Mankala-GUI)** to focus on UI implementation separately.

2. **Kirigami Tutorial & Setup:**
   - Followed the [Kirigami tutorial](https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/kirigami/introduction_getting_started/) to understand Kirigami components and structure.
   - Learned how to create a basic Kirigami window and experimented with different UI elements.Created a demo KountDown app.

3. **Challenges Faced & Solutions:**
   - **CMake Issues:** Initially, adding `find_package(KF6Kirigami2 REQUIRED)` in `CMakeLists.txt` was tricky as I faced missing dependency errors.
   -I faced build issues after this action , My objective was to start making UI changes in the main QML file and then change different qml files seperatley as I progress .
   - **QML Migration Issues:** Attempted to replace `ApplicationWindow` with `Kirigami.ApplicationWindow` in my main QML file, but the build failed.
   - **Merge Request for Review:**  I created a **Merge Request (MR)** .

4. **Mankala-GUI Implementation:**
   - Created a **landing page** with a simple layout and navigation.

   - Designed an **About Page** containing game details and credits.

   - Built a **Main Menu Page** with options to navigate through the app.

   - Added a pop up to choose options from the menu.
   - HUMAN VS HUMAN
   - HUMAN VS RANDOM
   - HUMAN VS MINMAX
   - HUMAN VS MCTF

### Next Steps
- Improve the **landing Page** later ,which is plain image in background with a button,simultaneously making certain refinements in other pages . 
- Implement the game board design and functionality.

- Gather more feedback from mentors and make necessary adjustments.
