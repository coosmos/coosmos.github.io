Hello again :) 

## 🌟 Week 3–4 Progress
### ✨ The Story So Far:  
The past two weeks have been pretty packed — mid-semester exams were in full swing, and balancing that with project work was a bit tricky. Finding time to focus on both wasn’t easy, but somehow things started to fall into place.  

I made solid progress with the **Game Board** design, though it took a few iterations to get it right. Got some helpful feedback from my mentor, **Benson**, which pushed me to refine the layout and improve the overall flow. Connecting the backend with QML was a challenge, but once it clicked, things started coming together nicely.  

### ✅ Achievements:
- Designed the **Game Board** UI using **Kirigami** and **QML**.
- Connected the backend to QML.
- Successfully implemented two variants:
  - **Bohenspiel**  
  - **Oware**
