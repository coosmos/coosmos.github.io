## 🌟 Final Week Update: Wrapping Up My SoK Journey

As the Season of KDE (SoK) 2025 comes to a close, I’m excited to share my final week update and reflect on this incredible journey of contributing to   **The Mankala GUI**.

---

## ✅ What I’ve Accomplished

Over the past few weeks, I’ve made solid progress on the Mankala project. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve done:

-  **Basic GUI Setup**: I’ve successfully set up a working and interactive graphical interface for Mankala.
-  **Two Game Variants**: Users can now play two variants — *Bohnenspiel* and *Oware* — directly from the UI.
-  **Board Redesign**: The board has been redesigned with a clean and modern look.

## 🐞 Things to Fix

While the core setup is functional, there are still several things I plan to fix or improve:

- ♻️ **Code Cleanup**: Some parts of the code (especially the board logic) are redundant and need cleanup.
-  **Responsive UI**: The board UI isn't responsive on different screen sizes and needs fixing.
-  **Pull Instructions from Engine**: The game instructions should ideally be dynamically pulled from the backend Mankala engine — this integration is pending.

## 🔮 Future Work

After SoK ends, here’s what I’d love to continue working on:

1.  **Extend UI** to support additional variants like *Pallanghuli* and *Kalah*.
2.  **Enhance Board Aesthetics** with better textures and polish.
3.  **Revamp Main Menu** using a clean card-based layout.
4.  **Modularize QML Code**: Organize scattered files into proper modules for maintainability.
5.  **Add Stone Animations**: Make the gameplay more interactive and lively with animations.

## 🙌 Wrapping It Up

This journey has been nothing short of incredible. When I started, I had no clue how to navigate or understand an existing codebase. But slowly and steadily, things started to make sense.

### Here's what I learned:

- ✨ Working with **Kirigami** and **QML**
-  Integrating **backend logic** into a frontend application
-  Understanding the **Git workflow** and collaboration via Merge Requests
- Team meets were fun to have ,sharing and learning about others contributions was inspiring .

Huge thanks to my mentor **Benson** , **João** , **Johnny** and everyone from the KDE community for the support and guidance. I’m truly grateful for this opportunity and I hope to continue making meaningful contributions to KDE.
